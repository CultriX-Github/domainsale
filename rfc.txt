                       draft-davids-forsalereg-06

Abstract

   This document defines an operational convention for using the
   reserved DNS leaf node name "_for-sale" to indicate that the parent
   domain name is available for purchase.  This approach offers the
   advantage of easy deployment without affecting ongoing operations.
   As such, the method can be applied to a domain name that is still in
   full use.

1.  Introduction

   Well-established services [RFC3912][RFC9083] exist to determine
   whether a domain name is registered.  However, the fact that a domain
   name exists does not necessarily mean it is unavailable; it may still
   be for sale.

Internet-Draft                 forsalereg                     April 2025


   Some registrars and other entities offer mediation services between
   domain name holders and interested parties.  For domain names that
   are not for sale, such services may be of limited value, whereas they
   may be beneficial for domain names that are clearly being offered for
   sale.

   This specification defines a lightweight and universal method to
   ascertain whether a domain name, although registered, is available
   for purchase.  It enables a domain name holder to add a reserved
   underscored leaf node name [RFC8552] in the zone, indicating that the
   domain name is for sale.

   The TXT RR type [RFC1035] created for this purpose MUST follow the
   formal definition of Section 3.1.  Its content MAY contain a pointer,
   such as a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) [RFC8820], or another
   string, allowing interested parties to obtain information or contact
   the domain name holder for further negotiations.

   With due caution, such information can also be incorporated into
   automated availability services.  When checking a domain name for
   availability, the service may indicate whether it is for sale and
   provide a pointer to the seller's information.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Rationale

   There are undoubtedly more ways to address this problem space.  The
   reasons for the approach defined in this document are primarily
   accessibility and simplicity.  The indicator can be easily turned on
   and off at will and moreover, it is immediately deployable and does
   not require significant changes in existing services.  This allows
   for a smooth introduction of the concept.

3.  Conventions

3.1.  General Record Format

   The "_for-sale" TXT record MUST start with a version tag, possibly
   followed by a string.





Davids                   Expires 28 October 2025                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                 forsalereg                     April 2025


   The formal definition of the record format, using ABNF
   [RFC5234][RFC7405], is as follows:

   forsale-record  = forsale-version forsale-content
   forsale-version = %s"v=FORSALE1;"
                     ; version tag, case sensitive, no spaces
   forsale-content = 0*244OCTET
                     ; referred to as content or data

   Records without a version tag MUST NOT be interpreted or processed as
   a valid '_for-sale' indicator.  However, they may still offer some
   additional information for humans when considered alongside a valid
   record, for example:

   _for-sale.example.com. IN TXT "I am for sale"
   _for-sale.example.com. IN TXT "v=FORSALE1;fscode=NGYyYjEyZWY"

   If no TXT records at a leaf node contain a version tag, processors
   MUST consider the node name invalid and discard it.

3.2.  Content limitations

   The TXT [RFC8553] (Section 2.1) record MUST contain any valid
   content, ranging from an empty string to meaningful text or URIs.
   Any text that suggests that the domain is not for sale is invalid
   content.  If a domain name is not for sale, a "_for-sale" indicator
   is pointless and any existence of a valid "_for-sale" TXT record MAY
   therefore be regarded as an indication that the domain name is for
   sale.

   This specification does not dictate the exact use of any content in
   the "_for-sale" TXT record, or the lack of any such content.  Parties
   - such as registries and registrars - MAY use it in their tools,
   perhaps even by defining specific requirements that the content must
   meet.  Content can also be represented in a human-readable format for
   individuals to interpret.  See the Examples section for
   clarification.

   Since the content of TXT record has no defined meaning, it is up to
   the processor of the content to decide how to handle it.

   See Section 5 for additional guidelines.

3.3.  RRset limitations

   This specification does not define any restrictions on the number of
   TXT records in the RRset, but limiting it to one is RECOMMENDED.  It
   is also RECOMMENDED that the length of the RDATA [RFC9499] per TXT
   record does not exceed 255 octets.  If this is not the case, the
   processor SHOULD determine which content to use.

   For example, a registry might select content that includes a
   recognizable code, which can be used to direct visitors to a sales
   page as part of its services, whereas an individual might simply
   extract a phone number (if present) and use it to contact a potential
   seller.

3.4.  RR Type limitations

   Adding any resource record (RR) types under the "_for-sale" leaf
   other than TXT is NOT RECOMMENDED.  Such records MUST be ignored for
   the purposes of this document.

3.5.  TTL limitation

   A TTL longer than 86400 is NOT RECOMMENDED.  Long TTLs increase the
   risk of outdated information persisting, potentially misleading
   buyers into believing the domain is still available for purchase.

3.6.  Wildcard limitation

   The "_for-sale" leaf node name SHOULD NOT be a wildcard, but
   processors MAY still analyze it if it is.

3.7.  CNAME limitation

   The "_for-sale" leaf node name MAY be an alias, but if that is the
   case, the CNAME record it is associated with it SHOULD also be named
   "_for-sale", for example:

   _for-sale.example.com. IN CNAME _for-sale.example.org.

   However, processors MAY follow the CNAME pointers in other cases as
   well.

3.8.  Placement of leaf node name

   The "_for-sale" leaf node name MAY be placed on the top level domain,
   or any domain directly below, with the exception of the .arpa
   infrastructure top-level domain.

Internet-Draft                 forsalereg                     April 2025


   It MAY also be placed at a lower level, but only when that level is
   mentioned in the Public Suffix List [PSL].

   Any other placement of the record MUST NOT be regarded as a signal
   that the domain above it is for sale.

   Table 1 provides further clarification.

     | Name                          | Situation          | Verdict  |
     +===============================+====================+==========+
     | _for-sale.example             | root zone          | For sale |
     +-------------------------------+--------------------+----------+

     +-------------------------------+--------------------+----------+
     | _for-sale.www.ccc.example     | Other              | Invalid  |
     +-------------------------------+--------------------+----------+
     | _for-sale.51.198.in-addr.arpa | infrastructure TLD | Invalid  |
     +-------------------------------+--------------------+----------+

                 Table 1: Allowed placements of TXT record

4.  Examples

4.1.  Example 1: A URI

   The holder of 'example.com' wishes to signal that the domain is for
   sale and adds this record to the 'example.com' zone:

   _for-sale.example.com. IN TXT "v=FORSALE1;https://buy.example.com/"

   An interested party notices this signal and can visit the URI
   mentioned for further information.  The TXT record may also be
   processed by automated tools, but see the Security Considerations
   section for possible risks.

   As an alternative, a mailto: URI could also be used:

   _for-sale.example.com. IN TXT "v=FORSALE1;mailto:owner@example.com"

   Or a telephone URI:

   _for-sale.example.com. IN TXT "v=FORSALE1;tel:+1-201-555-0123"

Internet-Draft                 forsalereg                     April 2025


   There can be a use case for these URIs, especially since WHOIS (or
   RDAP) often has privacy restrictions.  But see the Privacy
   Considerations section for possible downsides.

4.2.  Example 2: Various other approaches

   Free format text, with some additional unstructured information,
   aimed at being human-readable:

   _for-sale.example.com. IN TXT "v=FORSALE1;$500, info[at]example.com"

   A proprietary format, defined by a registry or registrar to
   automatically redirect visitors to a web page, but without a clearly
   defined meaning to third parties:

   _for-sale.example.com. IN TXT "v=FORSALE1;fscode=aHR0cHM...wbGUuY29t"

   The content in the following example could be malicious, but it is
   not in violation of this specification (see Section 8):

   _for-sale.example.com. IN TXT "v=FORSALE1;<script>alert('')</script>"

5.  Operational Guidelines

   DNS wildcards interact poorly with underscored names.  Therefore, the
   use of wildcards is NOT RECOMMENDED when deploying this mechanism.
   However, wildcards may still be encountered in practice, especially
   with operators who are not implementing this mechanism.  This is why
   the version tag is a REQUIRED element: it helps distinguish valid
   "_for-sale" records from unrelated TXT records.  Nonetheless, any
   assumptions about the content of "_for-sale" TXT records SHOULD be
   made with caution.

   It is also RECOMMENDED that the content string be limited to visible
   ASCII characters, excluding the double quote (") and backslash (\).

   In ABNF syntax, this would be:

   forsale-content     = 0*244recommended-char
   recommended-char    = %x20-21 / %x23-5B / %x5D-7E

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has established the "Underscored and Globally Scoped DNS Node
   Names" registry [RFC8552][IANA].  The underscored leaf node name
   defined in this specification should be added as follows:

Internet-Draft                 forsalereg                     April 2025


                   +=========+============+===========+
                   | RR Type | _NODE NAME | Reference |
                   +=========+============+===========+
                   | TXT     | _for-sale  | TBD       |
                   +---------+------------+-----------+

                          Table 2: Entry for the
                     "Underscored and Globally Scoped
                         DNS Node Names" registry

   This specification does not require the creation of an IANA registry
   for record fields.

   <NOTE TO RFC EDITOR: Adjust the text in this section before
   publication.>

7.  Privacy Considerations

   The use of the "_for-sale" leaf node name publicly indicates the
   intent to sell a domain name.  Domain owners should be aware that
   this information is accessible to anyone querying the DNS and may
   have privacy implications.

   There is a risk of data scraping, such as email addresses and phone
   numbers.

8.  Security Considerations

   One use of the TXT record type defined in this document is to parse
   the content it contains and to automatically publish certain
   information from it on a website or elsewhere.  However, there is a
   risk if the domain name holder publishes a malicious URI or one that
   points to improper content.  This may result in reputational damage
   for the party parsing the record.

   An even more serious scenario occurs when the content of the TXT
   record is not validated and sanitized sufficiently, opening doors to
   - for example - XSS attacks among other things.

   Therefore, it is RECOMMENDED that any parsing and publishing is
   conducted with the utmost care.

   There is also a risk that this method will be abused as a marketing
   tool, or to lure individuals into visiting certain sites or making
   contact by other means, without there being any intention to actually
   sell the particular domain name.  Therefore, this method is best
   suited for use by professionals.
